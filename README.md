# Projects
These are my projects during my time as an undergraduate student at UCLA.
In addition to the repositories listed here:
* I led a group project to create a [neural-based product search engine](https://github.com/the-data-science-union/DSU-W2025-Improving-Marketplace-Search).
* I was also a group member on a project to investigate [catastrophic forgetting](https://github.com/ved-phadke/math-156-project) in the training of Convolutional Neural Networks.

Please also check out my other [GitHub account](https://github.com/david-oplatka) for my work as a software engineering intern at Vectara.
