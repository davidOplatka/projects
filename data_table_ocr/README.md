My goal for this project was to streamline the data entry process by taking a screenshot or image of a data table found in some document (a pdf, textbook, slideshow, etc.) and converting this image into a .csv file that can be used for data analysis. The purpose of this task is to eliminate the need to manually enter data into an Excel file or other data table object. To accomplish this, I devised iterative techniques for segmenting data tables into rows, columns, and cells. I further implemented methods to isolate individual characters within each cell. I subsequently passed these characters into a convolutional neural network that I trained using a dataset with over 600,000 images. The CNN demonstrated excellent performance, accurately classifying 85% of unseen images across 93 distinct character classes.
